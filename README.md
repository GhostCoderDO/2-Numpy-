## 1) NumPy Intro

This section provides an introduction to NumPy and its basics.

## 2) Array Indexing and Slicing

Learn how to index and slice NumPy arrays effectively. Examples cover single-element access, slicing, and advanced indexing techniques.

## 3) NumPy Data Types

Explore the different data types supported by NumPy arrays. Understand type conversion and how to handle various types of data.

## 4) Handling NaN Values

Understand how to work with NaN (Not a Number) values in NumPy arrays. This includes detecting, replacing, and managing NaN values.

## 5) Statistical Operations

Discover how to perform statistical operations using NumPy. Topics include mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and more.

## 6) Shape, Reshape, Ravel, Flatten

Learn how to manipulate the shape of NumPy arrays. This section covers reshaping arrays, raveling, and flattening.

## 7) Creating Arrays

Explore different methods for creating NumPy arrays, including `arange`, `linspace`, `range`, `random`, `zeros`, and `ones`.

## 8) Conditional Selection

Understand how to use the `where` function for conditional selection and filtering within NumPy arrays.

## 9) Concatenation and Sorting

Learn how to concatenate and sort NumPy arrays. Examples include horizontal and vertical stacking, as well as sorting operations.
